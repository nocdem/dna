# DNAC TODO (HISTORICAL — frozen at v0.7.1)

**Current Phase:** Phase 23 Complete - BFT-Anchored Proofs (v0.7.1)
**Protocol Version:** v1 (Transparent amounts)
**Updated:** 2026-01-22 (FROZEN — see STATUS.md for current state)

---

## Protocol Decision

**v1 (Current):** Transparent amounts - amounts are plaintext in transactions.
**v2 (Future):** ZK amounts - STARKs (PQ-safe).

Phase 4 (Range Proofs) is deferred until v2 implementation.

---

## Completed: Phase 14 - Testing & Hardening

- [x] Integration tests (send/receive flow) - `test_send_receive` EXISTS
- [ ] Multi-party tests (Alice → Bob → Charlie)
- [x] Double-spend attempt tests - `test_double_spend` EXISTS
- [x] Multi-input double-spend tests (v0.4.0)
- [~] Nodus failure/timeout tests - PARTIAL (graceful SKIP when unavailable)
- [ ] Fuzz testing for parsing
- [ ] Wallet recovery tests
- [x] Genesis mechanism - Implemented in v0.5.0 (unanimous 3-of-3 authorization)

### ⚠️ TEST WARNING: Synthetic Funds

Some unit tests inject fake UTXOs directly via `dnac_db_store_utxo()`:
- `test_utxo_store`: 1000 coins
- `test_utxo_select`: 1500 coins (5 UTXOs)
- `test_db_*`: 350 coins

**Note:** Genesis system (v0.5.0) provides production-realistic token creation.

---

## Deferred: Phase 4 - PQ Zero-Knowledge (v2 only)

- [ ] Evaluate STARK libraries (winterfell, stone, ethSTARK)
- [ ] Design STARK-based range proofs
- [ ] Implement range proof generation
- [ ] Implement range proof verification
